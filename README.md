Please note that this is a snippet of the work I did in my S3L internship. 
1. Essentially, given a csv file of PG&E electricity data, the program would reorganize the data to feed it into a NeuralProphet model. 
2. This model would forecast values for the rest of the dates and give the sum of the entire projected yearly usage.
3. A plot would be generated as well
4. The bottom cell is a sample of the plotting/experimentation I did (before using NeuralProphet) to better generally visualize the relationship between energy consumption and variables such as temperature.
